Naturally, like any kid growing up with the Nintendo Wii and Playstation 2, games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, but they always felt very distant in terms of how they are made. Through most of my time spent playing games, I had no idea how they could go from concept to product and every time I tried it always seemed complex and out of my depth. 

However, growing up in Dundee bridged that gap through the culture and events held in the city's rich gaming scene. I remember going to the Dare to be Digital events held by Abertay every year with my family, it was a gift to be able to see all of the passion and creativity on showcase there. Seeing the student's projects and how even a simple game with a solid idea could create a fulfilling experience changed my perspective on game development. That was when I first had the thought "Wow, maybe I can do that too." 

Having left high school early and forcing my way through college to get to university, I taught myself the value of hard work and the power of focused decidation towards a goal. The biggest strength one can have is consistent, steady working and there are few industries where that is more fundamental than in the games industry.
